// PROJECT NOTES
  - How to prioritize/strucutre building this app. What happens first? What happens next?
  - Spend at LEAST the first few hours if not the first entire day just planning out what the app looks like. There are lots of moving pieces, so it is expected that your group will not work together. One of the goals of this project is to establish a cohesive working relationship and take "issues" as you go.
  - CREATE ISSUES?! WAFFLE?! OMG WAFFLE. 
  - You will need to split up the workload, and part of the grading rubric will be github workflow and that work is evenly distributed amongst group members.
  - This doesn't mean that one person in the group can decide to "be in charge of the CSS" and checks out for all of the redux. Each person in the group should be able to explain what every line of code is doing, and will be asked to demonstrate understanding during the evaluation. If something doesn't make sense, it is up to your group to make time to get everyone up to speed.
